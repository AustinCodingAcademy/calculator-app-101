# Calculator App for 101

Inside this repo you'll find HTML, CSS, and JS files that come together to build a calculator. It's a simple & ugly calculator but it works as is to add and subtract two numbers. You have some tasks to do to get it into a prettier and more functional calculator.
1. Go back to the web page view of the Calculator and see how it's working. Try adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, and modulusing to see what's missing so you can fix it.

> *HINT: the comments throughout the code are left for you to read and learn from.*

## What's Missing?

1. Part 1: the multiply, divide, and modulus functions need to be built. Can you figure out how to build them and `console.log` their results?
1. Part 2: in the `equals` function at the bottom of the `main.js` file you'll see the first two cases call the `putResultInElement` function with their corresponding operation functions passed into it. But the next three don't. Can you fix that so that your results show up on the page and NOT the console?

### Push Yourself Further

1. This calculator is ugly. Once you've got the functionality working, can you make it look better with CSS Grid?

## To Turn This Assignment In

1. Since you forked this repo you'll need to `git status, add, commit, push` the same way you've done before but now you'll create a Pull Request (*PR*). 

  > *NOTE: A PR is a request to merge your code changes into the original code base. This is what you'd normally do in your day job so that others can see the work you did for the day.*

1. Once you've made the PR you'll copy/paste the URL of the PR for your instructor to grade.
